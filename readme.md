# :wave: Bespoke Tool For Assets
## :nerd_face: Practical overview and learning outcomes
The goal of this lab is to learn how to create a simple tool to manage the assets in a game, e.g. a tile editor.
### Background to the Tasks:
* We have taken a number of steps for this final part. We are able to manage saving and loading the data for a map.
* We can display a map using tiles and so on.
#### Main Aim
* Using the previous labs (especially the last one), create a project that has:
* A Tile class
* A Map class consisting of tiles
* A means to load and save your data i.e. classes.
* A very *simple* editor.
* Use what we have learnt i.e. patterns e.g. singleton.
### Overall suggested Tasks
1. Create a tile class, e.g. use the same one from last week.
2. Create a map class, again use last week’s one with modifications if necessary.
3. Your map editor will be divided into a main screen for your map, and a small right hand side screen (about 1/3 screen width, or whatever you decide), where unique tiles are loaded in.
4. The previous step can be enhanced using a suitable GUI e.g. TGUI etc.
5. By selecting a tile on the right hand panel, you can now “paint” your main panel with your tiles.
6. Save and loading: use JSON, or csv. Note that as JSON requires more effort it will be awarded more marks.
